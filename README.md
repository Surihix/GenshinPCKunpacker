# GenshinPCKunpacker

 This small program allows you to unpack WWise audio banks or .wem stream files, that are stored inside the .pck files of the game.
 <br>

 Usage is pretty simple. just drag n drop a .pck file on to the program and it should quickly start unpacking the files into a new folder that will be created next to the .pck file.
 <br>

 The extracted files can be converted/played with [vgmstream](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream).
